#### Else Follow the below steps! To make your first contribution in this Pandemic vala Hacktober

#### Step 1
- Goto the GitHub repository of this project and fork the project to your account 
- Click on the fork button on the top right corner of the repository page to do it.
- Once done, GitHub will take you to the forked copy in your account.

#### Step 2
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- Click on the big green button saying "Clone or download" and copy the https url of your repository.
- Fire up the terminal (on linux systems ctrl+alt+t. on Windows open the Git-bash )
- Navigate to your desired directory and type the following command.
- Replace the link with the clone URL of your repository and hit Enter.

```

#### Step 3
- Let's start working on the changes required now! First cd into the cloned folder by typing the following command.

````
cd gitinit
````

- Now, Before jumping in to the code, make sure you're working on a different branch and not in master.
- To create a new branch, from the terminal inside your current project directory type the following command.
````
git branch YOUR_USERNAME-profile
````

- Replace the YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username or you can give any name to your branch which describes the purpose of the branch.
- Since here we're adding your profile, we'll simply give the name of the branch as above. eg: git branch kindavishal-profile.
- Once you have created the new branch we'll change the current brach from master to your newly created branch.
- Execute the following command on your terminal.

````
git checkout YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
````

#### Step 4
- In your  file manager/terminal navigate to the downloaded repo.
- Open the sub-directory src/profiles/ and create a new .md filewith your favourite list as the filename with .md extension.
- It should look like Your_fav_lsit.md eg: movies.md
- Open this file in your favourite editor and fill the details according to your interest.

#### Step 5
- Commit the changes with a suitable commit message.
- First we need to stage all the changes we made.
- Open the terminal inside the project directory and execute following commands.

````
git add -A
````

- The above command stages all the changes, now lets commit it with a suitable message.

````
git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
````

- Replace "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE" with a suitable message.

#### Step 6
- Let's push the changes to your repository 
- Execute the following command to push all the changes to the forked copy in your GitHub account.
````
git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
````

#### Step 7
- Now, open your web browser and goto the original repository on GitHub.
- If your changes has been pushed to your forked copy, You'll be able to see an option saying "New Pull Request" in the original repository.
- Click on the option, on the next page, choose the master branch of the main repo against your created-branch name ( choose your branch name we created and not master).
- Then click on "Create pull request".
- Once you fill in the commit message and comment, click on "Submit Pull Request".
